**Feature request rules**
This is just a template to help you post a useful issue.  Erase these rules and any irrelevant categories and content as you see fit.

- Only submit issues related to the latest version of the mod (and all dependencies) for the currently supported version of Minecraft (1.16.5).
- When referring to software versions always use the actual version number and never "latest".
- Do not request support for other mods (that should be done [here](https://github.com/ferreusveritas/DynamicTrees/issues/443)) or ports to other versions.

If you are opening this **for any other reason** than to request a new feature, it will be closed without explanation! For bug reports, use the bug report template.
